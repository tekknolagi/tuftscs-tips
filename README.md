# Classes

## COMP 105

### Topics covered

* Big-Step Operational semantics
* Scheme
* Higher-order functions
* Anonymous functions
* Continuation passing
  * SAT solver
* (S)ML
* Type systems
* Type checking
* Type inference
* Smalltalk and object-oriented programming
* ML modules and functors
* Lambda calculus

### Tips

* Read the book
* Don't just rely on SML/NJ. It tends to have poor error messages. Also try
  MosML and MLton (especially for error messages)
* Don't let the Greek letters intimidate you. They will make much more sense
  after the first lecture.
* Try to read the book's chapters before their corresponding assignments (maybe
  not the whole chapter, but the first 20-30 pages will give you a great
  start). Then it is easier to use as a reference when you are stuck.
* Scheme syntax is mostly new, but easy. It's all stuff you know but in a weird
  order and with a couple extra parentheses. Once you get this you'll be fine.
* As any other class, Halligan Helper gets full the last 2 days of the
  assignment. Be smart and get help before the rest of the crowd.
* Be able to justify each test. What corner cases does it test?
* Most hard homeworks have similar problems in the book, except that these are
  solved for you. Use them for inspiration ðŸ˜‰
* More technical stuff that is good to know (and you'll understand when you get
  to the topic):
  * `append` takes linear (O(n)) time and it's VERY different from `cons` (make
    sure to get the difference right from the beginning).
  * Functions passed to `foldr` and `foldl` have the element as the first
    parameter, and the accumulator as the second.
  * The order in which you pattern match *does* matter.

### Combining material

* Build your own Scheme interpreter while you are learning about uScheme. It
  will help you understand all of the following topics:
  * Operational semantics. You will make mistakes with the semantics of your
    interpreter. Many of them will stem from making incorrect or inconsistent
    assumptions about what should happen when. These ideas are formalized in
    operational semantics.
  * Scheme. Hopefully, since you're interpreting it, you understand more
    deeply how the language functions.
  * Higher-order functions. You'll need these for the standard library of your
    new language.
* Build a language from essentials. It is possible to start from the very
  basics and build a fully-functioning language from that.
  * Lambda calculus. This is a simple but fully Turing-complete language of
    expressions that can be used to bootstrap a fully-featured programming
    language.
  * Proofs of Turing completeness. This has great tie-ins with COMP 170. If you
    can prove that you can transform any program into this language, then you
    have a Turing-complete programming language. Roughly.
* SML, since it has not changed since 1997, has spawned a family of languages
  used by people who like the ideas presented but want to add more practical
  features.
  * [OCaml](http://www.ocaml.org/) and [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
    belong to this family. As Norman once said, "OCaml is for people who like
    SML but would rather be writing C", and Haskell is like SML with a
    ridiculously advanced type system, among other features.
    * [OCaml vs SML](http://adam.chlipala.net/mlcomp/)
    * [F#](http://fsharp.org/) is similar
  * Lazy evaluation. Haskell presents a concept called "lazy evaluation",
    meaning expressions are not (necessarily) evaluated when they are expressed,
    but instead when the results are needed.
* Type systems

## COMP 40

### Topics covered

* Introduction to C (for those coming from a C++ background)
* The benefits and drawbacks of the pair programming approach
* Using abstraction/modularity to write maintainable code
* Enforcing and reasoning about invariants to ensure program correctness
* Von Neumann architecture (especially: the significance of data and code living in the same memory)
* Reading and writing technical documentation
* Bits, bytes, and nibbles ("bits is bits", i.e.: data is subject to your interpretation)
* More of an in-depth view into what happens during compilation
* Caching and performance measuring
* Low-level arithmetic and representation of numbers
* Bitwise operations
* Reading and writing assembly code

### Tips

* Start the homework early, start the homework early, start the homework early-
  Comp 40 is not a *conceptually* difficult class- its main challenge is in the
  amount of time that you will have to spend coding.  If you start early, you
  will give yourself the time you need to 1. write the bugs that are inevitable
  and 2. fix the bugs and *learn* why they happened, rather than spend the whole
  semester in a debugging panic that teaches you nothing.
* Be an effective pair programmer.  The partners that you find yourself with
  during the semester will, mostly, be people you have never met.  The odds are
  that either they understand the course material significantly better than you,
  or that you understand the course material significantly better than they do;
  very rarely will you and your partner be a perfect match in terms of your
  understanding.  If this happens and they are the ones who understand more, take
  the time to ask them questions about what is going on in the code that you two
  are writing; it is *not* a waste of time, and it will help *both* of you to
  better understand the material.  If you are the one who understands more, be
  sure to stop periodically and check in with your partner.  Being able to
  explain the code and the course topics will reinforce your understanding, and
  might even be fun.
* Become acquainted with sites that contain documentation and Q&A resources,
  such as Stack Overflow and [Tutorials
  Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/).  They often have very
  clear examples and explanations of some of the standard library tools you will
  use.  For example,
  [this](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_sscanf.htm)
  may be a good place to read about one of the standard library functions you
  will use in the first lab.
* Be an effective HalliganHelper queue resident.  You will spend a lot of time
  on the HalliganHelper queue.  Before speaking with a TA, there are a number
  of steps you should follow:
  * First, you should run your code through a debugger (gdb) and/or valgrind.
    If you don't know how to use one or both of these tools, it is *absolutely*
    worth your time to meet with a TA at the beginning of the semester to get an
    introduction to these tools.  Humans are bad at reasoning about code, so you
    need to have some idea of what is actually going on in your code.
  * you should search google/stack overflow to the best of your ability
  * you should draw pictures, which will help to clarify both pointer questions
    and questions about your design (in terms of interactions between modules)
  * you should come up with an educated guess for what you believe the answer
    is, or might be, and why that is the case
  * you should explain to the TA what you have tried already. "My code is
    broken" and "Why is this segfault happening?" are common statements that a
    TA hears when they first walk up to a group, but are not helpful places to
    begin.
* You will be forced to read technical documentation and header (`.h`) files
  that will be provided to you.  If you run into code or jargon that you don't
  understand (especially `typedef` related constructs), you should follow the
  steps above and then talk to a TA if still confused.  Plowing through the
  confusion is rarely the right thing to do, and will cost you, in some cases, a
  significant amount of time.
* Learn effective Googling strategies.  For example, googling
  `site:stackoverflow.com sscanf` will limit your search results to Stack
  Overflow.
* As long as you try your best during the class, the points will work
  themselves out in the end. That's why the staff gives vague grades like "Very
  good", "good", etc.  Don't worry too much about your grades, don't stay in
  Halligan into the early morning hours, and please stay healthy :)

### Combining Material

* Write test programs. If you are curious "what would happen if..." or "why is
  my code doing xyz...", you should change the code, recompile it, and see what
  changes.
* Look for interesting questions on Stack Overflow's "Related" and "Hot Network
  Questions" sidebars.  There are a lot of interesting pieces of C trivia to be
  found by following those links.
* Write your own assembler for UMASM (the assembly language you write in during
  the last assignment)
* An excellent question asked by a student in COMP 15 one semester:
  * "We learned in lecture that we use a 'class' to store and model state and
    behavior.  I understand how we store state, because that's just data that
    we can store in memory.  But how does a class store behavior?"
  * Spend some time thinking about the answer to this question.  The answer
    reveals a lot of deeper, subtle points about the relationship between code
    and data.
* Explore other low-level, systems level languages such as Rust.  A good
  exercise is to implement the Universal Machine in Rust.
* Since the C standard library is so small, implement various data structures
  or other tools that would be useful to have in a language:
  * Implement various collections (hash tables, sets, etc.)
  * Implement [arbitrary-precision arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic)
  * Implement a library for precise real number arithmetic (i.e. make it so
    that 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3)
* Explore compilation (look for links in the [COMP 105](#comp-105) section).
* Design and implement your own VM
* Optimize your existing solutions, and learn about what kind of low-level
  optimizations can be made (bit twiddling hacks, inspecting assembly output,
  etc.)

### Other related material
Comp 40 gives you the tools to explore a large number of other topics:

* [Hardware emulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_emulation)
* Learn about
  [concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science))
  and how it works at a low-level
* Go more in-depth with low-level code
  * Read the coolest [stack overflow
    question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-it-faster-to-process-a-sorted-array-than-an-unsorted-array)
    ever
  * Low-level security
    * [Buffer overflow attacks](http://heartbleed.com/) (and also read this
      cool buffer overflow
      [story](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/194772/))
    * [Return oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming)
    * [This](https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/exploits/references/tr-2007-153.pdf)
      looks to potentially be a good resource for other low-level security
      exploits.
  * Learn about how potentially life-threatening
    [bugs](https://around.com/ariane.html) manifest themselves in low-level
    code
* Go on to explore higher-level languages, like Python, Java, functional
  languages, etc., using your low-level knowlede to reason about the
  performance of constructs in these languages.
* Find and contribute to open-source projects! This course gives you the ability to read large amounts of code, familiarize yourself with an existing codebase, and write real code.  Put it to use by giving back to the larger CS community!

## COMP 15

### Topics Covered:
* Your first guide to getting a software engineering job (interview questions!)
* Knowing the difference between the client side code (using functions without knowing its implementation details) and the implementation side code (the code that runs your functions as promised in your documentation)
* Introduction to C++ programs that utilize complex data structures
* Utilizing Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to write codes that are short and easy to understand
* Using abstraction/modularity to break down complex problems
* Allocating and managing dynamic memory and visualizing what happens under the hood (aliasing, deep vs shallow copies)
* Evaluating different data structures (sequences vs linked list, stacks vs queues) according to their time and space complexity
* Manipulating previous data structures (sequences, linked lists) to make more complex data structures (trees, heaps and more!)
* Writing code that must handle MANY test cases and handling exceptions
* Understanding Big O (asymptotic analysis) and why certain choices are better (first step towards becoming an engineer)
* Reading long specifications (~8 pages PDF) for homework assignments
* Writing technical comments and documents (README) that make your code easier to follow
* RECURSION, recursion, ..., [Recursion](https://www.google.com/search?q=aesthetics+of+being+short&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS710US710&oq=aesthetics+of+being+short&aqs=chrome..69i57.3764j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=recursion) has many merits beyond its aesthetics, which is one of the reasons why many programmers consider them important. It's a unique way of thinking that you should really familiarize yourself with
* Debugging at a new level and learning what can cause a segmentation faults in more detail
* Visualizing different sorting algorithms
* Learning to optimize your code and seeing how your choices of algorithm or data structure matter

### Tips:
* Start the homework early and read the homework specification early. COMP 15 is a new challenge for COMP 11 students and the leap might feel like a lot. At times, the document may seem confusing and there may seem like thereâ€™s too many things to consider at once. I know that there were students who started homework a few days before and got them done in COMP 11. In COMP 15, that is NO LONGER an option. You will get STUCK in automatic testing, even if your code works with simple input testing. Moreover, if you are confused, so are other students in your class and 2~3 TAs canâ€™t get to over 20 students at once. Really try to start early so that you can discuss your idea with the TA. You will realize that you think a lot clearer when there is no pressure, so really do try to start early.
* Before coding, try to draw out what you would like to do. After drawing out your idea, go talk to a TA to see if your code makes logical sense. Even complex ideas like recursion will all make sense once you begin drawing them out. Spend Friday understanding the documentation from the homework assignment, spend Saturday drawing out your idea, spend Sunday talking with your TA about the sketch that you have and then code! The TAs will talk about your sketch and idea when debugging instead of looking at your code to fix the bugs with you. If you have a good design, then you will avoid the mess of getting into bugs that are difficult to find, which will save you a SIGNIFICANT amount of time! 
* Utilize the [Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concept](http://www.studytonight.com/cpp/cpp-and-oops-concepts.php) and learn how to use [pointers](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/102/PointersAndMemory.pdf). Your code will become a lot more readable once you utilize these concepts and writing functions that are within 30 lines will become a lot easier. If the big ideas of COMP 15 are not clear, go to the office hours and get those covered ASAP! The way your code is graded will no longer be solely based on whether your code works. Your design matters too, as that is how it is done in industry, so really take the initiative to understand the big topics thoroughly!
* Become comfortable with walking through how data is stored, accessed and manipulated each time you cover a new data structure. Draw them out with the TAs and see why each data structure has the time and space complexity that it has. In particular, seek the TAs to learn and visualize how the complex data structures work, instead of seeking them solely for debugging! The TAs for COMP 15 are an awesome group and all have a very deep understanding of how the data structures work. You will see that even one wrong detail in data structures will lead to segmentation faults or unexpected behavior. Each line of code you write really begins to matter, so even if you understand, go check with the TAs to make sure you are crystal clear!
* Decisions, decisions, decisions! There are multiple right answers in data structures, which is why the question, "am I doing it right?" towards the TAs or the professors will give you a very mixed answer. Taking a well-informed decision after evaluating different options is a hallmark of a good engineer, so make sure you have a deep understanding of each data structure covered in class. There is nothing minor that you can skip in this class, as each new data structure is now a new option that you can consider for your upcoming homework or project. Each data structure has its own pros and cons, so learn how to evaluate and choose what you believe is the best for the problem you are trying to solve! 
* COMP 15 debugging tutorial:
  * Make sure that you are deleting each dynamically allocated memory (the variables that have been created using the new keyword) and draw out how the memory is being managed by your program. Drawing out how your memory work ensures that there are no memory leaks.
  * Ensure that you know the difference between using ['.' and '->' when using objects] (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1238613/what-is-the-difference-between-the-dot-operator-and-in-c).
  * Memory allocation can get overwhelming and segmentation faults in your code will be prevalent. The difficult part is that we can no longer rely on the compiler to locate your memory errors and there are concepts in coding that will be completely new to you, such as aliasing, deep/shallow copying and double deleting. Take a deep breath, make sure that you have started early enough so that you have the time to visit the TAs and try to understand what has happened to your code. One of the goals of COMP 15 is to develop good programming and debugging skills, so if your attempts to fix your code despite working out your logic has failed, discuss with your TA what you tried and the TA will teach you how to use the valgrind and gdb debugger. Once the TA shows you how to locate your errors, try to understand why this error occurred so that you not only understand why your code gave a segmentation fault, but also develop a deep understanding of the common memory allocation bugs.
      * This [tutorial](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs107/guide_valgrind.html) will give you an idea of what the common messages from the valgrind mean. It takes time to get used to, but it will give you a starting point on what may have gone wrong with your code.
      * Some of the common reasons segmentation faults occur is when your program accesses memory it is not supposed to access. So if you are going over the allocated memory in an array or trying to access NULL in your code, you will likely get a segmentation fault.
  * [Draw, draw, draw] (http://markfontenot.net/2015/01/18/memory-diagrams/). You should draw pictures and bring them to the TAs to clarify both what you intended and what is actually going on in your code. Drawing out your code will make debugging of logic errors, which you likely had no exposure to in COMP 11, a lot easier. This will help you make a better educated guess and the TA will be able to spot your error a lot faster. Consider the TA as a reference when your attempt to debug has failed, not as someone who will fix your code the instance it breaks.
* Exams and projects are difficult, but the professors are very understanding. Donâ€™t freak out and know itâ€™s okay to have a low score on the exam because at the end, the exams will curve well. The professors understand that they are throwing a lot at you and will reward you for your hard work. For projects in particular, they will initially feel overwhelming because this will be your first time coding with multiple classes and many pointers. However, continue to work hard and persist, as your efforts will worth it at the end :)

### Combining Material
* Practice [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) where you make test files for each function that you make. The goal of testing is to try to break your data structure and be as nasty as you can to it, since you want to prove that your code is very robust against potential bad inputs! Sometimes, you will be asked to submit your testing file in class because it is that important! Make your test file intake various arguments, even those that are not supposed to work. Make sure that your exceptions work the way you intended. The most common errors to check are off by 1 errors, exceeding capacity and empty container errors.
* If the ideas regarding data structures did not make much sense and you would like more resources, check out [mycodeschool](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2_aWCzGMAwI3W_JlcBbtYTwiQSsOTa6P) on youtube or [geeksforgeeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/). These are few of the many data structure resources out there that you may use to visualize the concepts. Donâ€™t try to copy off the code as that will ruin your learning experience, but know that thereâ€™s a lot out there since data structures is *essential* for tech interviews at top tech companies. If you resort to using other resources, use them for visualization only and for any other help, go to the TAs. Whatâ€™s truly important is that you understand how the code works so that you can show what you know during your future interviews :)
* Here are some data structures to explore beyond COMP 15 if interested.
  * There are numerous types of trees, but these seem to be the [main trees](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-types-of-trees-in-data-structures) that people know. 
  * Hash table optimizations to get [perfect dynamic hashing] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function).
*  There are standard template libraries in your book and [on-line](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_stl_tutorial.htm). Donâ€™t use them in class until you are explicitly told to do so; the purpose of this class is to understand how they work under the hood. However, familiarize yourself with them after you have coded them in class since that is what we use in the real world (now, it's your turn to be on the client side of the code).

### Other related material
COMP 15 gives you the opportunity to explore what happens under the hood and solve complex problems!
